# Version 3.2

## Introduction

On this nose cone design we tried and have it half-and-half so that the base part could cover half and also the cover to cover half. This was in order to make sure the parachute doesn't attach itself to the base part. We also added our first electronics chamber for the rocket. This is the chamber that houses the electronics bay which holds the electronic components. The servo mechanism was to shift from the nose to the electronics chamber. The design can be found [here](https://github.com/nakujaproject/airframev1/blob/8eca6001235c1c59b9d69e9f7931666770087936/Design/nose-basepart1.stl)

## Problem

The parachute maintained to attach itself on the top part rather than the base part. This make the ejection difficult since the parachute couldn't eject freely. When we were drilling we started off with a larger drill bit to drill the whole hole at once. The forces on the cutting edge corner were to high hence the electronics chamber weakened on the additive layers of 3D printing.

## Modifications

Trying to add spring mechanisms to the top part which covers the base part. This is to create an outward force which pushed the parachute out. We tried the next test starting of with smaller drill bits and gradually increasing the drill bit by a deviation of 1mm. We succeed in drilling through and mounting the servo motor.
