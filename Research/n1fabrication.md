# Design and fabrication of model rocket airframe using 3D printing 

## Abstract

In this paper, we describe the method to design and fabricate the airframe of the model rocket. Considering the lack of commercially available model rockets in Kenya, we designed and fabricated a low-cost model rocket using 3D printing. The airframe subsystem comprises a nose cone, body tube, fins, and parachute. For the material of the parachute, we chose nylon considering the lightweight and strength. The aerodynamic stability was confirmed by calculating the static margin using Openrocket software. 
We launched the developed model rocket and confirmed each subsystem worked properly. We believe this model rocket will be used for further development of the flight control system.
